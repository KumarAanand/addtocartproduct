        The Forte Lurex Linen Viscose Jacket in Mother of Pearl features lunar lavishness by night and by day: a blazer in a linen blend shot with lurex for a shimmering surface that shines like a star in the sky. it has a straight fit with well-defined shoulders and a shawl collar culminating in a button and has been flawlessly finished with three jet pockets with a sartorial feel.
